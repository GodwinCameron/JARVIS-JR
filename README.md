The personal AI assistant.
<br/>
J.A.R.V.I.S.JR is an OpenAI powered, personal AI assistant inspired by Marvel's _J.A.R.V.I.S._, Iron Man's personal AI assistant. While not as powerful as the inspiration, J.A.R.V.I.S.JR still lives up to the name! He can converse with you, he thematically responds as though he truly is _J.A.R.V.I.S_ with references to the MCU, record chats with timestamps, provide code in the form of snippets, play music through a YouTube iFrame, utilise higher ChatGPT models on request and has many hidden 'easter eggs' to discover, depending on your command / request.

<br/> 
If you access J.A.R.V.I.S.JR through the link above, you will need to provide your own OpenAI developer API key with a non-zero balance in your wallet. If you were sent here by me, I'd have included my API Key somewhere in our conversation. The API Key is currently stored in your browser's local storage for the time being, either clear your local storage to change it or alternatively navigate to the documentation page and click the appropriate button to reset your API Key &#40;There is currently no other way to do this&#41;.

### üó£Ô∏è Voice Commands
<p>Here are the currently coded voice commands, they will trigger some of the functionality that isn't simply 'talking with' J.A.R.V.I.S.JR:</p>
<p>p.s. The way J.A.R.V.I.S.JR works is by checking for these 'flagged' phrases before actually trying to understand what you're saying. If you notice J.A.R.V.I.S.JR keeps misinterpreting what you're saying, you may be using one of these phrases <strong>Inside your request</strong> causing it to flag before your request is interpreted. This is because the checker uses an <code>includes</code> method to test your request before ChatGPT even gets to see it to formulate J.A.R.V.I.S.JR's response.</p>

</details>

## üî• Getting Started
<p>To get a development build of this project up and running on your system make sure you have the following</p>

### Pre-requisites:
<ul>
<li>Node (installed on Hosting device)<span><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"> Node Offical Download</a></span></li>
<li>GitHub Desktop - <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Offical Download</a></li>
</ul>

### Cloning the repo onto your system:
<p>once you have Node and GitHub Desktop on your machine, head over to the top of this repo (the top of the page where you are reading this) and click on the green dropdown "Code" button:</p>
</br>

![code](https://github.com/GodwinCameron/CompNation/assets/71267628/6db53b1a-ac00-44c9-bcab-98655b43de9b)

<p>Then click the "Copy url to clipboard" button, or just manually select this link:</p>

<img width="406" alt="image 161" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d185281a-372e-4467-9009-a2292228c99a">

<p>After this, open up your GitHub Desktop, and select the Repository dropdown (if this is the first time you're using GitHub Desktop, the default repository should be "desktop-tutorial")</p>

![repo](https://github.com/GodwinCameron/CompNation/assets/71267628/260d94aa-a983-4487-ae91-536aa01a795d)

<p>Now select "Add" and then "Clone repository..."</p>

![add](https://github.com/GodwinCameron/CompNation/assets/71267628/e637eba0-c58c-407e-bbbf-ffe1c9aa6a34)

<p>Navigate to the URL tab and paste the link in that we copied from earlier</p>

![paste](https://github.com/GodwinCameron/CompNation/assets/71267628/5dfbf41b-6760-4a40-b5ec-aede4c915dc5)

<p>Now you can right-click on the Current repository dropdown once again and copy the repo path, this will make navigating in the command line easier.</p>

![path](https://github.com/GodwinCameron/CompNation/assets/71267628/021bd861-848b-4c07-a00d-dee1da3cd030)

<p>Great! Now the repository is on your machine and we're almost ready to run the development environment!</p>
<p>If you'd like to edit or change any of the code, you can either fork the branch or commit to your own GitHub account.</p>
</br>

### Running the Development Environment:
<p>For this section, you'll need to open up your command line, this is either Command Prompt (CMD) for Windows or Termianl for iOS.</p>
<p>Next, navigate to the repository by typing </p>

### ```cd [repo path]```

<p>and hitting enter. If you copied the path from the Cloning the repo onto your system section, then you can just it after the cd and a space. (note* if you're on Windows and the command line opens on a different drive by default, you will need to first access the drive where the repo is stalled before running the change directory command or it will not locate the path. You can do this by typing the the numeric of the drive followed by a colon, the drive numeric will also display at the start of the path if you coped from the GitHub Desktop tab. and example of that would look like this):</p>
<p>Command 1.):</p>

### ``` D: ```

<p>Command 2.):</p>

### ``` cd [repo path] ```

</br>
<p>Once you've navigated to the repository directory on your command line, type the following command:</p>

### ```npm i ```

<p>This will use Node's package manager to install all the relavent dependacies for running this development environment, and will take a couple minutes.</p>
<p>Once this command is completed, you can type the following command:</p>

### ``` npm start ```

<p>The development environment is now running on your local network!</p>
